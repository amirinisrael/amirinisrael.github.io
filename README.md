# How to Make the Platform for a "Pizza Rack"

A "pizza rack" is a big, flat, all-purpose bike rack that can carry heavy items. The name comes from the pizzas that bike couriers delivered late at night. Pizza racks are typically used on city and shopping bikes. This entry describes how to make the platform of a pizza rack.
 
The first thing to do when making a rack is to decide how large you want the rack platform to be. For example, if you plan to carry one shopping bag, measure its bottom and add an inch on all sides. The example in these instructions is based upon a large laptop computer.
Heavy-duty pizza racks are normally made out of 5/16" OD x 0.035" thick steel tubing (the European equivalent is 8mm OD x 1mm thick). You'll need to source these before you start. The sleeve used to connect the ends is one size up (3/8" x 0.028" or 10mm x 1mm).
The photo below shows the pieces used in the platform, prior to brazing.
 
## Tools and Materials
You will also need the following tools and materials to make the rack’s platform:
-	hacksaw or pipe-cutter
-	sandpaper
-	rat-tail file
-	5/16" tube bender
-	yardstick or steel ruler
-	"welder's" spring clamps
-	flat steel plate
-	torch kit, flux, brazing rod

## Cutting the Tubes
Start by adding up the lengths of the sides of the rack and cutting a tube to that length. 
You will also need 3 tubes the length of the long side, less the diameter of the tube, for support.

## Mitering the Support Tubes
The ends of the support tubes need to be mitered to match the shape of the rack. Do this with the rat-tail file. Occasionally stop to check the profile against the side of a tube.
The opposite end need that same treatment, but at exactly the same angle. Care should be taken so that the bottoms of the concave miters align.
If you have access to a milling machine, mitering is much easier.
  
## Marking the Corners of the Main Tube
The main rack tube is straight at the start. You will need to bend it accurately and along the same plane. Start by marking the corners of the main tube. 
-	The first mark goes at 1/2 the length of the long side 
(since the two ends meet at the center of the long side after it is bent).
-	The second mark goes one short side length beyond that first mark.
-	The third mark goes the long side length beyond the second mark.
-	The fourth mark goes the short side length beyond the third mark.

## Marking the Start/Stop Points on the Bends
Tubes are bent around a radius, so the corners must be marked so that you know where to start and where to finish each bend. Since each tube bender has a unique radius, calculate the start and stop by adding 1/8 x πD on each side of each mark. Please note that your diameter is bigger than the bender's diameter by the size of the tube (i.e. add 3/16" or 8mm to the diameter of the bender when calculating start and stop).

## Bending the Main Tube
There are two things to remember when bending a rack:
-	maintain the plane
-	compensate for spring-back
It is a good idea to bend over a flat surface. That way, the results will be flat if you maintain a constant distance from the flat surface.
To make a bend, position the bender so that the bend starts at the first mark. Most hand benders are marked so that you know where the bend starts. So align the start mark on tube with 0⁰on the bender. Then bend a little beyond 90 degrees and watch the spring-back. If necessary, repeat until the end mark on the tube aligns with the 90⁰ mark on the bender after spring-back.
 
Continue to the 2nd, 3rd and 4th bend in a similar manner.
When you are finished you should have a nearly flat rack. If it is not flat, take the time to bend it as flat as best you can. Brazing over a flat plate will further flatten the rack.
Please note that the ends will overlap, as rounded corners use less material than straight corners. 
Note: A hand bender can do this job as accurately as a bending jig, but not as fast. If you are planning on building many racks, jigs are essential.
 
## Clamping the Tubes and Cutting the Overlap
Clamp the recently bent frame of the rack to a flat steel surface. Measures the sides with a yardstick to ensure that the opposite sides are of equal length. Mark the overlap of the joint and cut to size.

## Cutting a Sleeve
Cut a short length of sleeve (3/8" or 10mm) and check that it slides on and off both sides of the join.

## Prepping the Tubes
All mating surfaces on the rack need clean surfaces for brazing. You will need to sand the outside of the tubes, the inside, and the mating edges. Wrap a thin strip of sandpaper around the rattail file to get inside the edge of the support tubes.

## Brazing the Tubes
Slip the sleeve over an end of the frame.
Clamp the frame of the rack to a flat steel surface.
Measures the sides with a yardstick to ensure that the opposite sides are of equal length. If you want to be extra careful, compare the length of the diagonal corners. The diagonal measurements should be the same length. 
Assemble the support tubes. File and adjust as necessary. When all three support tubes fit cleanly and are evenly spaced, clamp them to the steel plate.
Tack braze all the pieces together, while they are clamped to the plate. 
Once tacked, remove the clamps.
Fillet braze each contact surface, over the edge of the steel plate.
A flat plate and some clamps are all that’s needed to give good results for one-off racks. If you plan to build many racks, a brazing jig will get the job done faster as you will have to measure only once during set-up.
 
## Clean-up
Once the platform has cooled off, clean it and sand the mating surfaces.
